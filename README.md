# Sorter
The repo includes an abstract class <i>`Sorter`</i> that can be used to sort any data structure, provided that the data structure has implemented a <i>`length`</i> property and <i>`compare`</i> and <i>`swap`</i> methods. <br/>
The Sorter class separates the sorting logic from the data structure. <br/>
Some example data structures (string, array and linked list) are also included in the `data-structures` directory to show how to use the Sorter class and implement the required methods and properties.<br/><br/>

<b>NOTE</b> <i>The Sorter class uses the bubble sort algorithm to sort the data structures, which may not be efficient for practical use cases. You may implement your own sorting logic in the `Sorter` class based on your use case <i/>
