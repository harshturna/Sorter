# Sorter
The repo includes an abstract class <i>`Sorter`</i> that can be used to sort any data structure, provided that the data structure has implemented a <i>`length`</i> property and <i>`compare`</i> and <i>`swap`</i> methods. <br/>
The Sorter class separates the sorting logic from the data structure. <br/>
Some example data structures (string, array and linked list) are also included in the `data-structures` directory to show how to use the Sorter class and implement the required methods and properties.<br/><br/>

<b>NOTE</b> <i>The library uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort" target="_blank">bubble sort</a> which may not be efficient for practical use cases. You may implement your own sorting logic in the `Sorter` class based on your use case <i/>
