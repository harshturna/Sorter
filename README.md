# Sorter
The code includes an abstract class called Sorter that can be used to sort any data structure, provided that the data structure has implemented a length property and compare and swap methods. <br/>
The Sorter class separates the sorting logic from the data structure. <br/>
Some example data structures (string, array and linked list) are also included to show how to use the Sorter class.<br/><br/>

<i>It's important to note that the Sorter class uses the bubble sort algorithm to sort the data structure, which may not be efficient for practical use cases. However, the algorithm can be changed to a more efficient one based on the particular use case in the Sorter class. <i/>
