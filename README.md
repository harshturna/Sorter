# Sorter
The repo includes an abstract class called Sorter that can be used to sort any data structure, provided that the data structure has implemented a <i>`length`</i> property and <i>`compare`</i> and <i>`swap`</i> methods. <br/>
The Sorter class separates the sorting logic from the data structure. <br/>
Some example data structures (string, array and linked list) are also included to show how to use the Sorter class and implement the required methods and properties.<br/><br/>

<b>NOTE</b> <i>The Sorter class uses the bubble sort algorithm to sort the data structure, which may not be efficient for practical use cases. However, the algorithm can be changed to a more efficient one based on the particular use case in the Sorter class. <i/>
